This is the documentation of my code used for solar turbines.
  Challenge I: The code we used to clean and create a regresion equation. Output was specifically modified so that it could be used in a tableau dashboard
  Dashboard I: The dashboard used to help them discover an optimal quantity to order such that parts would arrive on time
  Challenge II: the code use to make a forecast r-squared based model used to help show what economic factors affect their market position
  Dashboard II: The results of the 3 models we created in challenge 2
  Challenge III: The code used to help track scrapped parts in their system
  Dashboard III: the tableau dashboard used to show results
